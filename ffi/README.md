# SSPI FFI

Implements multiple APIs, exported as a single dynamic library:
1. Implements [Windows SSPI]-compatible API, based on `sspi` crate.
2. Implements [Windows WinSCard]-compatible API, with support for emulated and system-provided smart cards.
3. Implements [Windows DPAPI]. While exported functions are not Windows DPAPI-compatible, output blobs are.

[DPAPI]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/cng-dpapi

# Feature flags

As all APIs are bundled in the same dynamic library, this crate provides feature flags to enable relevant parts:
- `tsssp` to enable CredSSP security package in the SSPI API. Note that Kerberos/NTLM/Negotiate security packages will always be available even without this flag.
- `scard` to enable WinSCard.
- `dpapi` to enable DPAPI.

There also two features that can be enabled to use an alternate rustls crypto provider:
- `aws-lc-rs` to use [aws-lc-rs] crate (takes precedence over `ring`).
- `ring` to use [ring] crate.

# Logging
There are two environmental variables that control logging:
1. `SSPI_LOG_PATH` enables logging when set and specifies the file where logs will be written.
2. `SSPI_LOG_LEVEL` sets log filter. See [`tracing-subscriber`’s documentation][tracing-doc] for more details.
