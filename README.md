# sspi-rs

**sspi-rs** is a Rust implementation of [Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rpc/security-support-provider-interface-sspi-). It ships with platform-independent implementations of [Security Support Providers (SSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rpc/security-support-providers-ssps-), and is able to utilize native Microsoft libraries when ran under Windows.

The purpose of sspi-rs is to clean the original interface from cluttering and provide users with Rust-friendly SSPs for execution under *nix or any other platform that is able to compile Rust.

## Overview

The sspi-rs works in accordance with the MSDN documentation. At the moment, [NT LAN Manager (NTLM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-nlmp/b38c36ed-2804-4868-a9ff-8dd3182128e4) is implemented and available for platform independent execution. It is also possible to create your own SSPs by implementing the [`SspiImpl`]() trait. More on that in the [Documentation](target/doc/sspi/index.html).

###### Ease of use
Some SSPI functions tend to be cumbersome, that's why sspi-rs allows to use SSPI in a convenient way by utilizing builders. Examples are available in the [examples](examples), [example section](#example), and [Documentation](target/doc/sspi/index.html).

## Usage
sspi-rs is included in the Cargo.toml like this:
```TOML
[dependencies]
sspi = "0.1.0"
```
After that you can `use` the types that you need.


## Documentation

Documentation will give you a comprehensive overlook of the crate. For the example of a simple use case, visit the [examples](examples) folder.

## Example

The usage of the SSPs is as simple as creating an instance of the security provider and calling its functions.

Here is an example of acquiring a credentials handle and a timestamp of their validity:
```rust
use sspi::{Ntlm, Sspi, CredentialUse};

fn main() {
    let mut ntlm = Ntlm::new();
        
    let (cred_handle, timestamp) = ntlm
        .acquire_credentials_handle()
        .with_credential_use(CredentialUse::Inbound)
        .execute()
        .unwrap();
}
```

Example of acquiring an SSP provided by Windows:
```Rust
let mut negotiate = SecurityPackage::from_package_type(
    SecurityPackageType::Other(String::from("Negotiate"))
);
```
